## Functionality: 
SQL project and practice

## Description:
SQL Zoo offers a comprehensive SQL tutorial with interactive exercises and quizzes. Users gain knowledge of SQL fundamentals to hone query skills, from basic commands to advanced queries. Users can write and execute SQL queries against existing databases while receiving real-time feedback to deepen their understanding of SQL concepts.

## Thoughts:
The queries started off basic but got increasingly complex. Complex queries require more abstract thinking and logic, like traditional coding. This practice was good for learning as the queries became advanced and required substantial thinking. Advanced synchronized or nested sub-queries were initially hard to understand. Joins were confusing before this project, but there was plenty of practice to aid understanding. Overall this was a good project to review basics while also learning advanced querying.
