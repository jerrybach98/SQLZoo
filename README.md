## Thoughts:
The exercises started with simple queries but progressively increased in complexity, requiring more abstract thinking and logical reasoning similiar to traditional coding. Initially, JOIN operations and nested sub-queries were challenging, but there was plenty of practice to reinforce understanding. Overall, this project was an effective way to review foundational skills while learning advanced querying techniques.


## Next Steps:
To apply my SQL skills in a realistic setting, I plan to work with a mock database like the Chinook dataset, which mirrors a digital media store. To simulate a real-world scenario, I will pose as an analyst being asked questions from a ceo. Iâ€™ll create and interpret query results into understandable insights and use tools like Tableau or Power BI for data visualization. This end-to-end process will mimic real-world projects, offering practical experience beyond online exercises.
